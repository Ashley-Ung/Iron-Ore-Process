# Iron-Ore-Process
A PLC program using Ladder Logic Programming for the materials delivery process of iron production that I am working on for fun since I am fascinated with the iron ore process. 

This program uses RSLogix 5000 to code in ladder logic as well as Studio 5000 Logix Emulate as the PLC controls emulator. RSLinx is used as the communication driver. 

The controller and modules used:
